# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For my project, I'd like to explore an alerting system.  For example, for people with certain health issues, the program would read their heart rate and alert them if it rises or falls dangerously.  Additionally, for a game, I might create an ax throwing game.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am not sure if I will collaborate.  If I do, it may be with Shelby Hong and Jimena.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

An overview of the conditions needed if I went through with the health tracker.
